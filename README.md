# 👻 GhostWriterDetector

Detect if your text is written by a human or generated by AI!  
A modern ensemble system for robust, explainable, and multi-lingual content inspection.

---



## 🌟 Overview

**GhostWriterDetector** is an advanced, user-friendly tool for identifying AI-generated content in any text.  
It combines classical machine learning and state-of-the-art transformer models with real-world datasets, all wrapped in a beautiful, interactive interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Paste or Upload**: Analyze any text, .txt, or .pdf file (supports English & فارسی)
- **Hybrid AI Detection**: Ensemble of classical ML (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and deep transformer (roberta-base-openai-detector)
- **Confidence & Voting**: Each model predicts separately; results are visualized, and a majority vote decides
- **Segmented Document Analysis**: Long docs are split and analyzed per section
- **Modern UX**: Light/Dark themes, chart visualizations, and clean UI
- **User Feedback**: Submit corrections to help the model learn and improve
- **Multi-language Ready**: English and Persian support (add more easily)
- **Open Architecture**: Easy to plug in new models or expand features

## 📈 Example Use Cases

- Academic integrity (detecting AI in essays & research)
- Journalism and news media verification
- Originality checking in education and publishing
- Content moderation in forums or social media
- NLP research and dataset benchmarking

## 🛠️ Quickstart

**Install requirements:**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn joblib datasets streamlit transformers pandas matplotlib PyPDF2
````

**Train classical model:**

```bash
python model_gen.py --train
```

**Run the app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works

* **Data**: Trained on open, real-world datasets such as [HC3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3) and [ai-vs-human](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zcamz/ai-vs-human-HuggingFaceTB-SmolLM2-360M-Instruct)
* **Classic ML**: TF-IDF feature extraction + Logistic Regression
* **Transformer**: Uses `roberta-base-openai-detector` for advanced text understanding
* **Voting Ensemble**: Both models predict; the app shows their votes and a final label with confidence
* **Feedback Loop**: Your corrections help improve future versions!

## 💡 Ideas for Expansion

* Add explainable AI (SHAP/LIME) to highlight important words
* Real-time monitoring for web/social media content
* Upload more file types (Word, HTML, Markdown)
* More languages and domain-adapted models
* REST API or Telegram bot interface
* User accounts, history, and analytics dashboard
* Live leaderboard or demo page for public testing
